# virtualfish

A Fish Shell wrapper for Ian Bicking's [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/), somewhat loosely based on Doug Hellman's [virtualenvwrapper](https://bitbucket.org/dhellmann/virtualenvwrapper) for Bourne-compatible shells.

You can get started by [reading the documentation on Read The Docs](http://virtualfish.readthedocs.org/en/latest/). (It's quite short, I promise.)

If virtualfish is useful to you, feel free to [make a weekly gift on Gittip](https://www.gittip.com/adambrenecki/) or [a monthly one on Flattr](https://flattr.com/submit/auto?user_id=adambrenecki&url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fadambrenecki%2Fvirtualfish%2F).

## A quickstart, for the impatient

1. `pip install virtualfish`
2. Edit `~/.config/fish/config.fish`, adding a line that reads `eval (python -m virtualfish)`
2. [Add virtualfish to your prompt](http://virtualfish.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html#customizing-your-fish-prompt)
2. `vf new myvirtualenv; which python`

See the docs to find out more about virtualenvwrapper emulation, auto-activation and other plugins, extending virtualfish with events, and more.
